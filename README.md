# Analyzing Network Protocols with Wireshark

This GitHub repository contains packet captures used in demonstrations for the *Analyzing Network Protocols with Wireshark* Pluralsight course.

The overwhelming majority of these packet captures are sourced from [Nick Russo's packet capture job aids](https://njrusmc.net/jobaid/jobaid.html).

The below sections are a "table of contents" for the packet captures in this repository.

## Module 2

* **[Clip 2](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m2/m2c2_eth_untagged.pcapng)**: Demonstrates untagged Ethernet frames.
* **[Clip 3](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m2/m2c3_eth_dot1q_trunk.pcapng)**: Demonstrates Ethernet frames with IEEE 802.1Q tags representing VLANs.
* **[Clip 5](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m2/m2c5_arp_broadcast.pcapng)**: Demonstrates an exchange of ARP Request and ARP Reply messages.
* **[Clip 6](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m2/m2c6_arp_gratuitous.pcapng)**: Demonstrates Gratuitous ARP messages.
* **[Clip 7](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m2/m2c7_arp_scan.pcapng)**: Demonstrates ARP-specific behavior of scanning tools, including (but not limited to) nmap, Nessus, and Qualys.

## Module 3

* **[Clip 3](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m3/m3c3_packet_too_big.pcapng)**: Demonstrates IPv4 packets with Don't Fragment (DF) bit variations through ICMP Echo Request and ICMP Echo Reply messages.
* **[Clip 4](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m3/m3c4_ipv4_fragments.pcapng)**: Demonstrates IPv4 fragmentation through large ICMP Echo Request and ICMP Echo Reply messages.
* **[Clip 5](https://github.com/ChristopherJHart/pluralsight-analyzing-network-protocols-with-wireshark/raw/main/m3/m3c5_traceroute.pcapng)**: Demonstrates IPv4 TTL value analysis.
