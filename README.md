# Analyzing Network Protocols with Wireshark

This GitHub repository contains packet captures used in demonstrations for the *Analyzing Network Protocols with Wireshark* Pluralsight course.

The overwhelming majority of these packet captures are sourced from [Nick Russo's packet capture job aids](https://njrusmc.net/jobaid/jobaid.html).

The below sections are a "table of contents" for the packet captures in this repository.

## Module 2

* **Clip 2**: Demonstrates untagged Ethernet frames.
* **Clip 3**: Demonstrates Ethernet frames with IEEE 802.1Q tags representing VLANs.
